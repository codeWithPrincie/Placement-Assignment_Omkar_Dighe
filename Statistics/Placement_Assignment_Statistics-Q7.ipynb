    "**Ans.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the variance of Y, we need to find the equation of the regression line for Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation of the regression line for Y can be obtained by rearranging the equation of the line of regression between X and Y, which is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "2Y + X - 5 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging this equation, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "2Y = -X + 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Y = (-1/2)X + (5/2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have the equation of the regression line for Y. We can use this equation to calculate the variance of Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Variance of Y:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of Y can be calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "var(Y) = var(X) * (slope of regression line for Y)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the variance of X is given as 4, we can substitute the values into the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "var(Y) = 4 * (-1/2)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "var(Y) = 4 * 1/4\n",
    "\n",
    "var(Y) = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the variance of Y is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Coefficient of determination of X and Y:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient of determination (R^2) represents the proportion of the total variation in Y that can be explained by the regression of Y on X.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the coefficient of determination of X and Y is the same as the squared correlation coefficient between X and Y, which can be calculated as the square of the slope of the regression line for Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "R^2 = (slope of regression line for Y)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "R^2 = (-1/2)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "R^2 = 1/4\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the coefficient of determination of X and Y is 1/4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Standard error of estimate of X on Y and Y on X:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error of estimate represents the average distance between the observed values and the predicted values from the regression line.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the standard error of estimate of X on Y, we use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "standard error of estimate of X on Y = sqrt((1 - R^2) * var(X))\n",
    "\n",
    "standard error of estimate of X on Y = sqrt((1 - 1/4) * 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "standard error of estimate of X on Y = sqrt(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for the standard error of estimate of Y on X, we use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "standard error of estimate of Y on X = sqrt((1 - R^2) * var(Y))\n",
    "\n",
    "standard error of estimate of Y on X = sqrt((1 - 1/4) * 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "standard error of estimate of Y on X = sqrt(3/4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the standard error of estimate of X on Y is sqrt(3), and the standard error of estimate of Y on X is sqrt(3/4)."
